    The law of the LORD is perfect, <br>

    the testimony of the LORD is sure, <br>
    making wise the simple; <br>

    rejoicing the heart; <br>

  <p>
    As the above passage from Psalm 19:7-8 states, the word of God pefect, sure, right, and pure, and it is my belief that immersing oneself in it is one of
    the most beneficial things one can do. PeriCopy is a tool that I created to help myself and others memorize scripture more effectively - I hope that you
    find it useful and that it serves you well as you seek the Lord through His word.

  <h3 class="section">Why Pericopy?</h3>
  <div class="hr"></div>
  <p>
    As mentioned above, the primary reason that I created PeriCopy was to help myself and others memorize scripture more effectively - I had found that most
    scripture memorization tools were focused on smaller sections and there were few tools that were designed to help with memorizing larger passages.
  </p> 
  <p>
    Another significant reason I started this project was to help fund friends (and hopefully myself one day) who are pursuing missions in unreached contexts.
    Currently, your donations go to support my friends who are attending an 8-month training program to bring the gospel to unreached language groups. If you
    would like to donate, you can do so <a href="https://churchatthecross.churchcenter.com/giving/to/ortiz-mission-support">here</a>.

        How does this work?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        When you recite a passage of scripture, PeriCopy will compare what you said to the actual text of the passage. From there, it will calculate a score
        based on how many words you got correct and how many you got wrong. You can then view your score and compare your recitation to the actual text.

        Where is my data stored?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Your data is stored locally on your device. PeriCopy uses IndexedDB to store your recitation attempts, goals, and other data. This means that your
        data is not stored on any external servers and is only accessible from the device on which you are using PeriCopy. To back up your data or move it
        to another device, you can use the "Export Data" and "Import Data" buttons under the history page.
