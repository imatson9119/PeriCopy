  <p class="introduction">
    One of the major reasons I created this tool was to help provide funding to
    friends who are pursuing ministry. I plan on rotating the people that these
    donations go to every few months, and currently, the donations are going to
    support the Ortiz family. Read about them below:  
  </p>
  <p>
    The Ortiz's are embarking on a 10-month training program designed to train
    missionaries to go to people groups who have no bible translation. They are
    passionate about bringing the gospel to those who have never heard it
    before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your donation will help support their training, travel expenses, and living
    costs during this program.
